# Playing with Caching
You can find a solution for experimenting with output caching in this repository.

Output caching middleware is simple and requires only a few lines of code.
However, things become complicated when authentication comes into play.
The DefaultPolicy does not allow caching for endpoints that require authorization.

You can create a custom policy based on the built-in default, but you need to ensure the default policy is excluded, which can be easy to overlook.

I believe the solution lies in the extension method.
I created [some methods to help manage output caching](OutputCachingApi/Core/Extensions.cs) in the same way as the built-in version.
I also added an example that tags the cache with the username. This feature not present in the built-in version, but greatly needed.

## In the example the set-up is the following

- By default, caching is disabled, so you need to explicitly enable it on the desired endpoint
- Tag all cache entries with 'tag-all'
- If the endpoint requires authorization, tag it by username and with 'tag-auth'
- With the extension methods, it is easy to apply the [custom policy](OutputCachingApi/Core/DefaultAuthCachePolicy.cs) that allows caching for authenticated endpoints
